RESTful API Documentation and Best Practices

Introduction
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing and consuming 
our RESTful API services. Proper authentication, rate limiting, and error handling 
are essential for successful integration.

Authentication and Authorization

API Key Authentication
All API requests must include a valid API key in the request header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

API keys can be generated through the developer portal. Keep your keys secure 
and never commit them to version control systems.

OAuth 2.0 Flow
For user-authenticated requests, we support OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow:
1. Redirect user to authorization endpoint
2. User grants permissions
3. Receive authorization code
4. Exchange code for access token
5. Use access token for API calls

Token Refresh
Access tokens expire after 1 hour. Use refresh tokens to obtain new access 
tokens without requiring user re-authentication.

Rate Limiting

Standard Tier: 1,000 requests per hour
Premium Tier: 10,000 requests per hour
Enterprise: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in response headers:
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 950
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640000000

Exceeding rate limits results in 429 Too Many Requests response. Implement 
exponential backoff when encountering rate limits.

API Endpoints

User Management
GET /api/users - List all users
POST /api/users - Create new user
GET /api/users/{id} - Get user details
PUT /api/users/{id} - Update user
DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete user

Data Operations
GET /api/data - Query data with filtering
POST /api/data - Create new record
PATCH /api/data/{id} - Partial update
DELETE /api/data/{id} - Remove record

Analytics
GET /api/analytics/summary - Aggregate metrics
GET /api/analytics/trends - Time-series data
POST /api/analytics/query - Custom queries

Error Handling

Standard HTTP status codes are used:
200 OK - Request succeeded
201 Created - Resource created successfully
400 Bad Request - Invalid input
401 Unauthorized - Authentication required
403 Forbidden - Insufficient permissions
404 Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
429 Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded
500 Internal Server Error - Server-side issue

Error responses include detailed messages:
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Invalid email format",
  "field": "email",
  "code": "INVALID_EMAIL"
}

Best Practices for Integration

1. Always validate SSL certificates
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Cache responses when appropriate
4. Use webhooks for real-time updates
5. Monitor API usage and performance
6. Handle errors gracefully
7. Keep API keys secure
8. Use pagination for large result sets
9. Implement request timeouts
10. Log API interactions for debugging

Pagination
Use limit and offset parameters:
GET /api/data?limit=50&offset=100

Response includes pagination metadata:
{
  "count": 1000,
  "next": "/api/data?limit=50&offset=150",
  "previous": "/api/data?limit=50&offset=50",
  "results": [...]
}

Webhooks
Register webhook endpoints to receive real-time notifications:
POST /api/webhooks
{
  "url": "https://your-domain.com/webhook",
  "events": ["user.created", "data.updated"]
}

Webhook payloads include event type, timestamp, and relevant data.

SDK and Libraries
Official SDKs available for:
- Python: pip install our-api-client
- JavaScript/Node.js: npm install our-api-client
- Java: Maven/Gradle dependency
- Ruby: gem install our-api-client

Example usage (Python):
from our_api_client import APIClient

client = APIClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
users = client.users.list(limit=10)
for user in users:
    print(user.email)

Performance Optimization
- Use HTTP/2 for connection multiplexing
- Enable GZIP compression
- Implement client-side caching
- Batch requests when possible
- Use field filtering to reduce payload size

Security Considerations
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use HTTPS for all requests
- Implement request signing for sensitive operations
- Monitor for unusual activity patterns
