Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Content Search

Overview
This document outlines requirements for implementing semantic search capabilities 
across our content management platform. The goal is to enable users to find 
relevant documents using natural language queries rather than keyword matching.

Business Objectives
1. Improve content discoverability by 50%
2. Reduce time-to-find from 5 minutes to 30 seconds
3. Increase user engagement with historical content
4. Support 1 million documents with sub-second search latency

User Stories

As a content manager, I want to search using phrases like "Q4 earnings presentation" 
so that I can quickly find relevant financial documents without knowing exact titles.

As a researcher, I want to discover related documents even when they use different 
terminology, so that I don't miss important context.

As an analyst, I want search results ranked by relevance score so that I can 
prioritize reviewing the most pertinent documents first.

As a team lead, I want to understand what content exists on specific topics 
so that I can avoid duplicate work.

Functional Requirements

Search Functionality
- FR1: Support natural language queries of 3-500 characters
- FR2: Return results within 1 second for 95% of queries
- FR3: Display relevance scores (0-100%) for each result
- FR4: Show preview snippets highlighting matched content
- FR5: Support filtering by file type, date range, author

Content Indexing
- FR6: Automatically index uploaded documents
- FR7: Support PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text files
- FR8: Extract text content maintaining context
- FR9: Process documents in background for large files (>5MB)
- FR10: Update index when documents are modified/deleted

Relevance Ranking
- FR11: Use semantic similarity for relevance scoring
- FR12: Boost results based on recency (optional)
- FR13: Consider document popularity/view count
- FR14: Allow users to provide feedback on result quality
- FR15: Continuously improve ranking based on user interactions

User Interface
- FR16: Prominent search bar on all pages
- FR17: Auto-complete suggestions as user types
- FR18: Display thumbnail preview for visual content
- FR19: Highlight matching terms in results
- FR20: Enable sorting by relevance, date, title

Technical Requirements

Architecture
- TR1: Use transformer-based embedding model
- TR2: Implement vector database for embeddings storage
- TR3: Design for horizontal scalability
- TR4: Support multi-tenant isolation
- TR5: Ensure GDPR compliance for EU users

Performance
- TR6: Index 1000 documents per hour
- TR7: Handle 100 concurrent search queries
- TR8: Maintain 99.9% uptime SLA
- TR9: Store embeddings efficiently (<2KB per chunk)
- TR10: Support incremental index updates

Security
- TR11: Respect document access permissions
- TR12: Log all search queries for audit
- TR13: Encrypt embeddings at rest
- TR14: Sanitize user input to prevent injection
- TR15: Rate limit API to prevent abuse

Non-Functional Requirements

Usability
- System should be intuitive for non-technical users
- Search interface should load in <200ms
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Support keyboard navigation for power users

Scalability
- Support up to 10 million documents
- Handle 10,000 searches per minute at peak
- Gracefully degrade under high load
- Implement caching for common queries

Maintainability
- Code coverage >80%
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Monitoring and alerting for key metrics
- Automated deployment pipeline

Success Metrics

Adoption
- 80% of users perform at least one semantic search per week
- Average of 5 searches per active user per day
- 70% of searches return clicked results

Quality
- User satisfaction rating >4.0/5.0
- <5% of searches result in "no results found"
- 80% of results rated as "relevant" or "very relevant"

Performance
- Average search latency <500ms
- 99th percentile latency <2 seconds
- Zero-downtime deployments
- <0.1% error rate

Dependencies and Assumptions
- Users have reliable internet connectivity
- Documents are in standard formats (not scanned images)
- Sufficient compute resources for model inference
- Access to GPU for initial model fine-tuning

Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Poor quality results for domain-specific terminology
Mitigation: Fine-tune model on company-specific corpus

Risk: High infrastructure costs for embeddings storage
Mitigation: Implement efficient compression and tiering

Risk: User resistance to new search interface
Mitigation: Gradual rollout with extensive user education

Risk: Performance degradation as index grows
Mitigation: Implement index sharding and distributed search

Timeline and Milestones
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Core search functionality
Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Advanced features and UI polish
Phase 3 (Weeks 9-10): Performance optimization
Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12): Beta testing and refinement

Launch: End of Quarter 1, 2025
